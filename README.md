# Adel Journey
A game inspired by SuperTux (The art style is very similar to old SuperTux's art style) but the player is kinda slow and has the ability to throw bombs!

Or at least that's what I plan to make. Things could change!

## Story 
A penguin named Adel just goes to explore an island of many strange things. Adel is an adelie penguin with larger eyes, that's all you really need to know. If you close your eyes slightly, she might look like the version of Tux from SuperTux 0.6.3 and below until SuperTux 0.1.0.

It just so happens that another penguin is there, and the other penguin is evil and wants to take over the island.

## Planned "Sections" of the island
The "worlds" in this game are called sections. Here's the different sections! They have 2 levels each.
- [ ] Industrialized Forest (A forest with many trees... that have all been cut down. There's a big factory in this forest)
- [ ] Coconut Desert (This is where some dangerous moving coconuts are. Watch out!)
- [ ] Frozen Lake (A giant lake that has now been frozen)
- [ ] Metal Tower (A tall tower that leads to a cloudy sky)
- [ ] Cloudy Sky (You must go here if you wanna reach the Sky Castle)
- [ ] Sky Castle (Scary castle, as it's the final world after all)
The name of the island is Emperor Island.

## How to build the game
It's not even been worked on yet, why would you wanna build it right now? 

Also, the versions of Haxe and HaxeFlixel used to build this are outdated right now! 

Wait until I upload the source code and then I'll add build instructions here.
