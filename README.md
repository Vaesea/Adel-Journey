# Adel Journey
A game inspired by SuperTux (The art style is very similar to old SuperTux's art style) but the player is kinda slow and has the ability to throw bombs!

Or at least that's what I plan to make. Things could change!

## Story 
A penguin named Adel just goes to explore an island of many strange things. Adel is an adelie penguin with larger eyes, that's all you really need to know.

## Credits
- Vaesea (Main creator of the game)
- SuperTux Team (They made SuperTux, and this game, especially the art, is very inspired by SuperTux. This is basically a clone of SuperTux but you will be able to throw bombs)

The name of the island is Emperor Island, named after Emperor Penguins. It also just so happens the main villain is an Emperor Penguin.

## Build Instructions
### What you need to install:
- Haxe 4.3.7 (https://haxe.org/download/version/4.3.7/)
- HaxeFlixel 6.1.0 (Use haxelib install flixel 6.1.0)
- Lime 8.2.2 (Use haxelib install lime 8.2.2)
- Flixel Tools 1.5.1 (Use haxelib install flixel-tools 1.5.1)

### What you need to do after installing the libraries:
- Keep the terminal open (If you closed it, re-open it)
- Use the command "haxelib run lime setup"
- Go to the folder of the game (Make sure you can see the Project.xml file!)
- Open the terminal on your computer
- Use the CD command to go to that directory
- Type "lime test (Platform) -debug"
- It should be building now!

You can replace platform with the Operating System you're using, these are the commands for Windows, Mac and Linux:
- lime test windows -debug
- lime test mac -debug
- lime test linux -debug

You have to be on the specific Operating System you're compiling for.

I know you could use something like lime build (Platform) -release, but since this is in development, I put the other command.

If you already have the things to compile Friday Night Funkin', you probably have the things to compile this, since this and FNF use HaxeFlixel.
