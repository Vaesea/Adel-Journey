# Adel Journey
A game inspired by SuperTux (The art style is very similar to old SuperTux's art style) but the player is kinda slow and has the ability to throw bombs!

Or at least that's what I plan to make. Things could change!

## Story 
A penguin named Adel just goes to explore an island of many strange things. Adel is an adelie penguin with larger eyes, that's all you really need to know. If you close your eyes slightly, she might look like the version of Tux from SuperTux 0.6.3 and below until SuperTux 0.1.0.

It just so happens that another penguin is there, and the other penguin is evil and wants to take over the island.

## Credits
- Vaesea (Main creator of the game)
- SuperTux Team (They made SuperTux, and this game is very inspired by SuperTux)

The name of the island is Emperor Island, named after Emperor Penguins. It also just so happens the main villain is an Emperor Penguin.

## Build Instructions
I'll need to upgrade my Haxe and HaxeFlixel versions first before I can write build instructions, and they'll be in the wiki instead, not the readme.

## Other planned things
These things are for the finished game, not the versions before that, although these could be added for the versions before it. I don't know how to code these right now so a pull request by someone else might be necessary for these to be added.
- [ ] Modding Support (Possibly using polymod?)
- [ ] Level Editor (Thinking of using Ogmo Editor v3 for now but this might exist?)
- [ ] Hscript Support (This would be nice to have if a level editor is added so there could be scripting for levels, basically like SuperTux) (Would need a level editor to be added because otherwise it'd be useless)
