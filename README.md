# Adel Journey
A game inspired by SuperTux (The art style is very similar to old SuperTux's art style) but the player is kinda slow and has the ability to throw bombs!

Or at least that's what I plan to make. Things could change!

## Story 
A penguin named Adel just goes to explore an island of many strange things. Adel is an adelie penguin with larger eyes, that's all you really need to know. If you close your eyes slightly, she might look like the version of Tux from SuperTux 0.6.3 and below until SuperTux 0.1.0. You can see the rest of the story on the wiki.

## Credits
- Vaesea (Main creator of the game)
- SuperTux Team (They made SuperTux, and this game is very inspired by SuperTux)

The name of the island is Emperor Island, named after Emperor Penguins. It also just so happens the main villain is an Emperor Penguin.

## Build Instructions
I'll need to upgrade my Haxe and HaxeFlixel versions first before I can write build instructions, and they'll be in the wiki instead, not the readme.
